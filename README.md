* File sharing and Text Sharing Website

I developed a dynamic file and text sharing website using React.js,
Expressjs, and MongoDB Atlas. The website enables users to easily
share files through personalized links and offers QR code scanning for
swift downloads. Users can also share text content conveniently using
unique links. By leveraging modern technologies like React.js and
Expressjs, along with Multer middleware, I created an efficient
platform for seamless file and text sharing.
